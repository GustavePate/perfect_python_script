A demonstrator and reminder for the most usefull python libraries

DONE
------


TODO
-----

- logging
- collections -- specifically namedtuples
- csv -- always use this to read/write CSV files, don't try and roll your own methods, it'll end in tears
- sqllite
- datetime
- math -- try and use these functions rather than the global ones, as they're faster when you import them into the global namespace
- re -- regular expressions
- string -- I rarely see this used, but it's very handy
- tempfile -- always use this to create temporary files
- pandas -- csv loading and quick graphing
- matplotlib
- unittest
- requests -- if you need to do any http requests at all, use this
- lxml -- always use this for working with XML data
- ujson -- faster than both simplejson and the built-in json modules, handy if you work with lots of/big JSON blobs
- PyYAML -- for working with YAML docs.
- nose -- for unittesting
- buildout -- I'd recommend this over virtualenv any day
- BeautifulSoup -- for webscraping and/or parsing potentially malformed HTML
- docopt -- if you're writing command-line scripts/tools, use this over optparse/argparse
- os / shutils
